differnce b/w statically-types and Dynamically


statically-types - need datatype for variable like in java , c++ c#
eg - int num = 10;
num = "a" --- wrong

Dynamically - no need of datatype (in js)
eg - int num = 10;
num = "a" --- data change
Math.round(num); --- give NAN

in short TS is just js with check type;
